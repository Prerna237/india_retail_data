To explore a bit about what is the data about, I plot some basic graphs and run some functions to understand the data
- Histograms to visualize the distribution of prices
- Box plots to identify the outliers

The four questions that I'd like to answer through this EDA are:
1. Which commodity has shown steeper price hike over the years
2. Which factor plays the most significant factor in price hike (Date, Region or Centre?)
3. Which centre has the highest cost of living?
4. Are certain commodities more expensive during certain months of the year?
