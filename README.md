# Questions
 - Use [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) library for modelling.
 - Provide exploratory data analysis(EDA). This include visualizations and insights gathered from each visualization. Find this **[example](https://bibinmjose.github.io/dsgramner/ipython_md/analysis.html)**. Include correlation plots as well.
 - Afterwards, create a distilled version of the EDA with most significant insights. Find the progression of our **[example](https://bibinmjose.github.io/dsgramner/)**.
 - Create a regression model which predicts future prices with a confidence band. You may create/add new features based on the dataset as well as external sources (include source reference).
 - Tune the model to achieve [MAPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error) of less than <5.
 - Find the most important features from your model and substantiate them.
